#Simple Journal

A very simple web interface for notes and journal entries. Allows for writing and reading journal posts, can display by tag or date. Also allows you to edit or delete existing journal entires. Is NOT even remotely secure--do not use in a production enviornment.

Utilizes PHP, HTML, and CSS.
